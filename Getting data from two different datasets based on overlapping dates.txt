##codes to get overlapping datasets based on date

# Load Set B data
set_b = pd.read_csv(r'D:\\Trail\\data2.csv')#This had AOD DATA

# Merge datasets on the common date column
merged_data = pd.merge(set_a, set_b, on='date')

# Access the merged AOD and PM2.5 columns
overlapping_dates = merged_data['date']

# Create a new DataFrame with the overlapping data

# Export the result to a CSV file
result.to_csv('D:\\Trail\\Overlappingdata.csv', index=False)
